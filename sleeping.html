          <p>Most of us feel that there is not enough time in the day. Sometimes we steal some sleeping hours to get things done but optimally our body craves sleep and we know it is time to rest. Spending a third of our day sleeping may seem like a waste of time with all we have to do, but it is necessary as sleep is still apart of the human cycle. I recently have been listening to health specialist Max Lugavere’s podcasts, and one I found particularly interesting was about sleep with nutritionist Shawn Stevenson from The Model Health Show. Here are a few fascinating facts that I found by listening to this podcast!</p>


          <div class ="row"> <div style= "width:200px; font-size:70%; text-align:center;" class ="column"><figure>

          <div style= "width:200px; font-size:80%; text-align:center;" class="column"><figure>
            <img src="img/modelhealthshow.jpg" alt="" style="height:150px;border:0;font-size:60%; text-align:center; padding-bottom:0.5em;" ><figcaption>Shawn Stevenson from the Model Health Show</figcaption></div></div>

        <!--  <h2 class="section-heading">Cortisol</h2> -->

          <p>→ Cortisol is our body’s main stress hormone also known as a built in alarm (7). Studies show that lack of sleep from one or two days before relates to higher cortisol levels at night (Hint: the tired fights after working all day long) (1). Clearly, getting a goodnight sleep can fix this. Shawn recommends getting a few minutes whether it just be 5 minutes of sun exposure first thing in the morning. This creates a spike in cortisol levels that will gradually decrease throughout the day. Getting a good night sleep starts when you wake up so take a few extra minutes to get a morning walk or park far away at work to get a walk in before sitting in the office. </p>

            <!--<h2 class="section-heading">Number of Hours of Sleep </h2> -->
          <p>→ Whenever I get less than exactly seven hours of sleep I tell myself I am sleep deprived because I follow the “at least 7-8 hours a day” rule very seriously. Shawn reasoned in the podcast that there really is not a set number of hours to sleep since everyone is different. The National Sleep Foundation (NSF) recommends 7-9 hours but this information has been changing. The NSF tells people to note down how they feel with different amounts of sleep to see what is right for you. See what is best for you but aim to get the 7-9 hours each night (2).</p>


          <!--<h2 class="section-heading">Shift Work = No No</h2> -->
          <p>→ If you don’t have the ideal 9-5 job like most people don’t, lets hope its not the other 9-5. Shift work messes up all 5,000 hormones that go into the circadian rhythm to have you sleep at night. For those that do not know the circadian rhythm is an internal sleep-wake cycle that regulates every 24 hours and can be manipulated by sunlight and temperature (3). A study found that nurses who did shift work were 30% more likely to develop breast cancer than those who did not work late hours. Shawn said in order to be healthy or most commonly lose weight, you must stop shift work and sleep normally. </p>

        <!--  <h2 class="section-heading">Blacking Out</h2> -->

          <p> → The weekend rolls around and time to get some good drinks. No problem sipping some drinks with some friends but when someone blackouts, there are countless reasons why this is bad and one has to do with sleep quality that night. When someone blacks out, their R sleep is suppressed from drinking. Even though the person may seem to be sleeping, their short term memories that are usually processed during the R phase are disrupted. This is why people cannot remember what happened. Learn to drink without messing up your sleep cycle and the following day.</p>

        <!--  <h2 class="section-heading">Melatonin</h2> -->
          <p> → Melatonin is known as the sleep hormone. It helps regulate the internal sleep-wake cycle which is the circadian rhythm (4). What is covered by the hype of melatonin’s relation to sleep is its ability to promote fat loss. A study tested on mice found that melatonin supplementation increased brown adipose tissue (BAT) and an improvement of cholesterol and triglycerides level without adjustment to other factors other than increase melatonin (5). Brown adipose tissue gets its name because it is dense with mitochondria that has iron in it making it brown, and brown fat is specialized to burn fat compared to another type of fat called white fat (6). In mice, the brown fat burns more calories and there is a direct relation between mice with extra brown fat and being leaner (7). Bottomline, if you take melatonin to help you sleep you might also be helping to build that brown fat and lose some weight. </p>
