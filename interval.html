          <p>When time is tight but want to get an effective workout in, interval training may be the answer. Within just 30 minutes you’ll be burning more calories than a steady pace workout and can incorporate both cardio and strength training. I met with trainer, Dennis Stacknick, from the Chatham Club to talk about interval training, and why he continues to incorporate this workout with his clients. Dennis became passionate in strength and weight training in college when he was running track and cross country. Taking his new passion for the gym and building muscle and cardio, he likes to combine the two in many forms and one is interval training. </p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Really Understanding What Interval Training Is</h2>
          <p> Interval training may sound straightforward but with High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) and Tabata in the loop, it is important to be clear of the difference -if you can even distinguish any. Dennis describes interval training as short sprints of high intensity exercises with minimal recovery. Recovery times are included in interval training between the high and low intensity intervals. According to Studio Sweat, HIIT is a form of interval training which involves near exhaustion intervals and low intensity intervals that conclude when too exhausted. Tabata cannot be forgotten. Tabata is a form of HIIT training with shorter rest periods. </p>



  <p>To explore the difference between HIIT and interval training, HIIT is really focusing on the near exhaustion intervals and minimal recovery. Whereas interval training, the focus is the difference in intensity but may not be near exhaustion. “Near exhaustion” may sound intimidating for some people. It may take time to build up those near exhaustion intervals. By the time you build up to that intensity, you are proving to yourself that your heart has gotten stronger and you’re more fit to handle those intense intervals!  </p>

  <p>An example of building up the intensity is trying 15 seconds of all out high intensity then 30 seconds recovery. After sometime, work with those ratios until you can achieve 20-60 seconds of high intensity and 10-15 seconds of recovery. Listen to your body to know when you are ready to advance to a different ratio. </p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Optimizing Your Workout Time</h2>
  <p>The high intensity intervals in this setting pushes your heart outside its comfort zone strengthens and grows your heart (nerdfitness). Dennis explains that increasing heart rate then slowing it down for the low intensity interval in a control fashion also strengthens the heart. Clearly, interval training is great to strengthen and grow your heart. </p>



  <p>People not only like interval training for the heart benefits but also the calories burned. Interval training burns more calories than a steady pace cardio workout. An After Burn Effect is very significant with interval training (runtastic). This means you are burning calories even after you workout. Dennis noted that interval training can slow down the aging process and increase the human growth hormone to burn more calories taking part in the After Burn Effect. </p>


  <p>Interval training is great because it is effective for minimal time and will not get boring! Just throw in a new exercise into the set, instead of mountain climbers with gliders for cardio do high knees. The possibilities are endless.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">How Often</h2>
  <p>Try to stick to interval training 3-5 times a week since the high intensity bursts may be draining for 5 times a week. This workout should make you feel energized and accomplished afterwards, not depleted. Push yourself through those tough intervals but find the proper times to not feel dead after one round.
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Kinds of Workouts/ Results</h2>
  <p>Dennis does interval training with his clients and has seen results. He may do a superset- where you do two exercises with no break in between- with a cardio burst at the end. Another example is his client doing two strengthening exercises then 30 seconds on rower and a 30 second sprint on the treadmill. He has seen results with clients and improvements in their ratios which holds this kind of workout promising!</p>


  <p>If have minimal equipment at a gym or in your room, finding a longer power band or braided band may be best for you. With this you can try the band across back then resisted push up, bent over rows with band underneath a table or couch, tricep exercises, stand on band and weighted squats, and many more. </p>

<p> A medium weight kettlebell provides many different full body exercises such as goblet squats, swings, pistol curls for biceps, and farmer or suitcase carries. </p>
<p>Gliders are also a great piece to get your hands on to add in the cardio or core. If no gliders, use a towel on a smooth surface. Choose any two strength moves and a core move afterwards then a cardio exercise at end and repeat!</p>
<h2 class="section-heading">What My Interval Training Is Like</h2>
<p>I always try to do interval training! It's so easy, fun, and I never get bored! </p>
<p><ul> Erg Machine Quick Workout <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">

  <li> Erg (rower) for 4 minutes or for the duration of song about same length </li>
  <li>  Warm up activation exercises: hip bridges, dead bugs, leg swings, cat to crow, downward dog, mixture of these to activate the core, glutes, legs, etc for the workout, so important to get the core fired up to mentally and physically train the usage of core when moving other body parts than using lower back!</li>
  <li> Erg for 4 minutes </li>
  <li>Now core exercises, flutter kick 30 reps, scissors 50 reps, leg raises 20 reps, and one minute plank with leg taps for 20 reps each side. To make it harder, keep your legs slightly above the ground. Not there yet? Raise them up! Repeat 3-4 sets and don’t forget to tuck hips under to engage core!</li>
  <li> Back to erg - 4 minutes </li>
  <li> Now arms! Tripcep curls, standing row (heavier), go lighter and do some flys, push ups, tricep dips, military press, any sort of arms you want for about 15 reps and 3 sets! </li>
  <li> ERG! If you didn't guess already - 4 minutes </li>
  <li> Now cool down </li>


</span> </ul></p>
  <button onclick="myFunction()" id="myBtn">Read more</button>
  <script>
  function myFunction() {
      var dots = document.getElementById("dots");
      var moreText = document.getElementById("more");
      var btnText = document.getElementById("myBtn");

      if (dots.style.display === "none") {
        dots.style.display = "inline";
        btnText.innerHTML = "Read more";
        moreText.style.display = "none";
      } else {
        dots.style.display = "none";
        btnText.innerHTML = "Read less";
        moreText.style.display = "inline";
      }
    }
  </script>

  <p> Modification is key - I do not have much stamina on the erg machine, so I can only go at a good, fast pace for about 4-6 minutes, but everyone is different! Again, try it out, play around with ratios modify the strength exercises to make it harder or easier and make it your own!! </p>
  <p>I  love circuits! I choose 3-4 exercises and do 3-4 sets of them <p>
    <li> An example would be bosu ball shuffles for 35 seconds, decline push ups on medicine ball, lateral squat with dumbell, plank renegade rows, plank with side taps and repeat! </li>
    <li> I like to start with a cardio exercise to get the heart rate up and burn more calories. Bosu ball is great or mountain climbers, jumping jacks, or burpees</li>
    <p>Carl Me Crazy’s jump rope workout is great. I also made a variation myself. Just grab a jump rope, choose a duration for this cardio, and do any exercise you want and then back to jump rope! Simple as that! </p>

    <p>Lots of information! Make your own variation of interval training or take an example from here with your modifications if needed and strengthen that heart and burn those calories without spending more than an hour at the gym!</p>
