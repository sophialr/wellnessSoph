          <p>If people have ever heard of something being golden that is typically referring to the turmeric ingredient. Turmeric is a bright orange/ yellow root that dies food a nice golden color but be careful it can also die your fingers, clothes, and teeth a golden color too. One reason to love turmeric is definitely because of its color, but there are many more. Turmeric has been around since 2500 BCE, and started to be used as a medical agent in 500 BCE. It became incorporated in Ayurvedic medicine which is a way of natural healing in India. In past Indian culture, turmeric's fumes would be burned and inhaled to treat many diseases, viruses, and more (1). Today, we are enlightened with more research on the benefits of turmeric that prove this spice will continue to dominate. </p>

          <p>The most important compound in turmeric is curcumin. Curcumin possess all the powerful benefits of turmeric but only makes up 3% and is not easily absorbed in the bloodstream (5). To help aid in the absorption, black pepper is typically paired with turmeric to be sure people are absorbing the curcumin in the most efficient way.</p>

          <p>Anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen are seen all around the market. A close competitor to some of these drugs is simply curcumin. Curcumin has anti-inflammatory properties that can reduce the risk of Alzheimers, since Alzheimers is brain inflammation that causes neuron killing (7). This property is also crucial in easing arthritis. </p>

          <p>Another property is antioxidant. Antioxidants help fight aging and disease. In some detail, curcumin blocks highly reactive molecules that can cause damage to living cells through oxidative stress (3). These molecules are known as free radicals. Curcumin also boosts antioxidant enzymes in your own body.</p>

          <p>Turmeric increases brain function and memory, which correlates to helping treat Alzheimers through the anti-inflammatory component mentioned above (2). Another benefit of turmeric are the great ways turmeric helps depression. It is hypothesized that curcumin  regulates serotonin and dopamine. It also inhibits the monoamine oxidase enzymes that would degrade neurons and cells such as serotonin. Curcumin helps promote growth and development of nervous tissue too (6). Also, turmeric can ease menstrual cycle pains and may lower the bad cholesterol known as <q>LDL</q> (4).</p>

          <p>The list goes on and on as research continues to pour out. On the surface of our bodies, turmeric is used in face masks as well to treat stubborn acne. When purchasing turmeric, it is important to make sure the product is pure and being bought from a trustworthy supplier. Be careful if you are prone to kidney stones because turmeric contains 2% oxalate and a high dose of turmeric can provoke kidney stones (5). Now it is time to get turmeric to work and show off the golden food created to friends and family.</p>
